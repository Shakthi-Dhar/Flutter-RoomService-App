# Room Service applicaiton

At present most of the hostels work on room service requests by conventional methods like maintaining a notebook where entries are to be made by the students requesting room service and similarly the service providers need to provide their acknowledgments in the register stating the accomplishment or closing of the service ticket raised.

>__“Every problem has a solution, although it might not be the Outcome that was originally Hoped for or expected”__

To solve this manual labor of jotting down things in a register and to maintain a constant track of the details and requests. I have developed an android application for the Room Service provision, that tackles all the problems mentioned in the above problem statement, which are:

- Digital platform to maintain records of service requests raised
- Mobile app allows the hostellers to stay in their room and raise a service ticket with the details of their room and free timings
- A Digital platform by which service providers view pending service tickets and get the job done, instead of checking register every time
- Easy Management, after the service, is provided the students can close the service request ticket which means that the service is provided, if not the management can take the required steps in order to tend to it
